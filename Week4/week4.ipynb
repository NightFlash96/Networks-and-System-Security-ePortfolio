    "\n",
    "- Integrity Checking: A preventive technique that detects unauthorized changes to files or system components.\n",
    "- Hashing (SHA-256): Generates a unique fingerprint for each file; even a one-bit change produces a completely different hash.\n",
    "- Baseline Comparison: Security systems record “clean” file hashes and later compare them to detect tampering or infection.\n",
    "- Malware Connection: Many viruses modify executable files — this method detects such unauthorized changes.\n",

    "The code below is a script which loops through the files in the folder ```files``` and generates a SHA-256 hash for each. The results are saved in a CSV file with the file name, hash and time stamp."

    "Security systems rely on file hashes instead of time stamps or file sizes because timestamps and file sizes are easily manipulated. A malicious actor can change a file without affecting the timestamp or size in a noticeable way. Hashes (such as SHA-256) provide a unique fingerprint of a file's content. Even a single-byte change will result in a completely different hash, making it obvious when someone has tampered with a file. This is a strong method of integrity verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Malware can try to replace legitimate files with malicious ones of the same size to fool naive checks based on size alone. Sophisticated malware can modify a file and restore the original hash by exploiting weak hashing algorithms or using a hash collision attack. A collision attack is weakness where two different inputs can produce the exact same, identical hash values. This is rare, but it can happen. Lastly, some malware will entirely disable or bypass integrity-checking software.\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens if a legitimate system update changes many hashes?\n",
    "When an update legitimately modifies files, their hashes will naturally change. If the system is too strict, it would flag these as false-positives. To avoid this a system should:\n",
    "1. Maintain a whitelist of trusted software updates. \n",
    "2. Use signed update packages to verify the authenticty of an update before updating the hash database.\n",
    "3. Updating the hashes immediately after an update, so that they match the most up to date files."
